This set of scripts are beased on a master script I found folating on the internet by Valetov "Heretiqu3" Konstantin.

I am using his script as a starting point to develop a new set of scripts for automatic install of Gentoo onto UVa@Wise's cluster.

-includes
  Holds any config file that you want to be used across the cluster

-scripts
  Holds all the scripts that are used to install Gentoo

-stages
  Holds stage3 files that have been downloaded from the gentoo mirror of your choosing
